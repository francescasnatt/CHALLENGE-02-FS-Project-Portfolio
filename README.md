# CHALLENGE-02-FS-Project-Portfolio
This project is my online web design portfolio.

## Description

<!-- This project depicts a Marketing Agency's website. It highlights the services they provide and certain benefits that users will receive by using these services.

A key part of creating the project involved refactoring the files to ensure the codebase follows accessibility standards and therefore is optimised for search engines. During this process I learned that certain elements such as semantic HTML elements, alt text in images and short descriptive titles all improve accessibility for users who require assistance in navigating and interacting with the web. -->

This project is my online web design portfolio. It highlights deployed applications I have worked on and the benefits of hiring me.

I was motivated to create this portfolio as I wanted to be able to display my work in a visually appealing and organised way. It also allows prospective employers to easily get in contact with me if they so wish. A key hurdle in creating this project was working out how to approach the task as a whole. My first attempt was a disaster, so I scrapped it, wrote up a step-by-step plan and started from there. I got much further with a plan in hand an having drawn up some wireframes.
