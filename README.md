# CHALLENGE-02-FS-Project-Portfolio
This project is my online web design portfolio.

## Description

This project highlights deployed applications I have worked on for past clients and the benefits of hiring me.

I was motivated to create this portfolio as I wanted to be able to display my work in a visually appealing and organised way. It also allows prospective employers to easily get in contact with me if they so wish. A key hurdle in creating this project was working out how to approach the task as a whole. My first attempt was a disaster, so I scrapped it, wrote up a step-by-step plan and started from there. I got much further with a plan in hand an having drawn up some wireframes.
